\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a machine learning approach to address two important challenges in smart grid management: energy load forecasting and grid fault detection. By using environmental data, such as temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation, alongside historical energy consumption, a Decision Tree Regressor was trained to predict future energy loads, while a Random Forest Classifier was employed to detect grid faults. The models were assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for load forecasting and classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for fault detection. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting energy consumption and identifying faults, contributing to improved grid stability and efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid growth of renewable energy sources and the increasing complexity of modern power systems have led to a rising need for advanced smart grid technologies. \cite{9562769}Two key challenges in managing these smart grids are accurately forecasting future energy consumption and detecting grid faults in real time.\cite{9719287} Precise energy load forecasting is crucial for maintaining a balance between supply and demand, ensuring system efficiency, while timely fault detection is essential to prevent costly outages and reduce maintenance expenses.\cite{9272794}\cite{9616552}

Traditional methods for load forecasting and fault detection typically rely on statistical models\cite{10361234}. However, these models often struggle to capture the complex and dynamic nature of modern power systems. To address these limitations, this paper presents a machine learning-based approach. Specifically, a Decision Tree Regressor is used to predict future energy consumption, taking into account multiple influencing factors, while a Random Forest Classifier is applied to detect grid faults.\cite{10128623} This combination of machine learning techniques offers a more robust, accurate, and efficient method for managing the challenges of today’s evolving power grids\cite{10045350}. By leveraging data-driven models, this approach significantly improves upon traditional methods, enhancing overall grid stability and operational efficiency.\cite{9781114}


\subsection{Related Work}

Energy load forecasting has been widely researched using techniques like time series analysis, regression models, and neural networks\cite{9498299}.\cite{9653484} In recent years, machine learning models have gained attention for their ability to provide more precise predictions\cite{10199644}\cite{10366922}. Similarly, fault detection in smart grids has been approached with a variety of algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.\cite{9793230} However, there has been limited research that integrates both load forecasting and fault detection within a unified framework, leveraging a combination of environmental factors and historical data for more comprehensive smart grid management.\cite{10391483}

\subsection{Dataset Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean Energy Consumption: 29.9 kWh
\item Grid Fault Occurrences: ~5.6\% of data points represent grid faults.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methodology}
\subsection{Load Forecasting}
A Decision Tree Regressor was implemented to predict energy consumption in the smart grid. Decision trees were chosen for their ability to model non-linear relationships and capture complex interactions between features without the need for extensive data pre-processing.\cite{10414965} \cite{9814101}The selected features included environmental variables such as temperature (°C), wind speed (m/s), and solar radiation (W/m²), alongside historical energy consumption data, as these factors significantly influence energy demand based on weather conditions and renewable energy availability.\cite{10451496}

Feature engineering was key to improving model performance. Two important lag features were introduced: Lag\_1 - energy consumption in the previous hour and Lag\_24 - energy consumption 24 hours earlier,\cite{10543583} which captured both short-term and daily consumption patterns\cite{10571417}. Additionally, interaction terms such as Temp\_Wind\_Interaction were created to account for the combined effects of environmental factors on energy demand\cite{}. The dataset was split into 80\% training data and 20\% test data. To prevent overfitting and ensure generalization to unseen data, hyperparameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, and split criterion were tuned using cross-validation.\cite{10578179} The model was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, which measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, providing a clear assessment of the model's accuracy.\cite{9823542}
\subsection{Fault Detection}
For grid fault detection, a Random Forest Classifier was employed, utilizing an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce variance\cite{10602838}.\cite{10578198} The model was designed to classify whether a grid fault occurred (1 = fault, 0 = no fault) based on historical grid data and environmental factors\cite{9821003}.\cite{10690834} Input features included temperature, wind speed, solar generation, wind generation, and energy consumption, along with interaction terms such as Solar\_Wind\_Generation and Temp\_Wind\_Interaction\cite{10698351}. These interaction terms provided additional insights into the conditions under which faults occurred, enabling the model to identify patterns indicative of grid faults.\cite{9070245}

The dataset was split into 80\% training data and 20\% test data. Hyperparameters of the Random Forest model, including the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf, were optimized using a grid search method.\cite{9144891}\cite{9272794} The model's performance was evaluated using \cite{9842829}\cite{9806180}classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to ensure accurate fault detection while minimizing false positives and negatives.\cite{9403923}

\section{Results}
In this study, the Decision Tree model showed notable effectiveness in forecasting energy loads, especially with the inclusion of lag features like previous hour and daily consumption patterns. These features significantly improved the model's accuracy, as reflected in the Mean Absolute Error of 7.017 kWh. However, the model struggled with periods of rapid changes in energy consumption, suggesting that more advanced techniques, such as gradient boosting or ensemble methods, could be explored in future research to further enhance prediction accuracy during volatile conditions.

For fault detection, the Random Forest Classifier delivered strong results. By incorporating environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and solar generation, the classifier was able to capture patterns indicative of grid faults. The model's high precision of 0.90 and recall of 1.00 for non-fault occurrences underscore its ability to accurately detect faults while minimizing false negatives. Though it missed detecting some faults (as indicated by a lower recall for fault detection), its overall performance suggests that the Random Forest Classifier could be effectively used in real-time grid monitoring systems to improve operational reliability and response times. This integrated machine learning approach provides a promising direction for enhancing smart grid management.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance energy load forecasting and grid fault detection in smart grids. The Decision Tree model performed well for load forecasting, especially with the inclusion of lag features, but there is room for improvement. Exploring more advanced algorithms, such as gradient boosting, could help address the model's limitations during periods of rapid fluctuations in energy consumption.

The Random Forest Classifier also delivered strong results in fault detection, showing high precision and recall for identifying non-fault cases. Although it missed a few fault detections, its overall accuracy indicates that it could be effectively used in real-time grid monitoring systems, helping to improve grid stability and operational efficiency. By combining environmental data with machine learning techniques, this approach provides a powerful tool for managing modern power systems, making them more adaptable and responsive to changing conditions. Future work could focus on using more sophisticated models to further enhance these systems' predictive abilities, ultimately leading to smarter and more reliable energy management.
