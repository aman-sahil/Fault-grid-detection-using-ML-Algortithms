\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a machine learning approach to address two important challenges in smart grid management: energy load forecasting and grid fault detection. By using environmental data, such as temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation, alongside historical energy consumption, a Decision Tree Regressor was trained to predict future energy loads, while a Random Forest Classifier was employed to detect grid faults. The models were assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for load forecasting and classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for fault detection. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting energy consumption and identifying faults, contributing to improved grid stability and efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid expansion of renewable energy sources and the increasing complexity of power systems have created a growing demand for advanced smart grid technologies. Two critical challenges in smart grid management are predicting future energy consumption and detecting grid faults in real time. Accurate energy load forecasting is essential for balancing supply and demand, while prompt fault detection helps prevent system outages and minimizes maintenance costs.

Traditional approaches to load forecasting and fault detection often rely on statistical models, which may struggle to fully capture the intricate dynamics of the system. In response to these limitations, this paper proposes a machine learning-based solution. A Decision Tree Regressor is employed to predict future energy consumption, while a Random Forest Classifier is used to detect grid faults, offering a more sophisticated and efficient method for managing modern power systems.
\subsection{Related Work}
Energy load forecasting has been widely researched using techniques like time series analysis, regression models, and neural networks. In recent years, machine learning models have gained attention for their ability to provide more precise predictions. Similarly, fault detection in smart grids has been approached with a variety of algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. However, there has been limited research that integrates both load forecasting and fault detection within a unified framework, leveraging a combination of environmental factors and historical data for more comprehensive smart grid management.

\section{Data Description}
\subsection{Data Overview}
The dataset used in this study consists of hourly measurements of key environmental and grid-related parameters over a period of one month, from September 10, 2024, to October 9, 2024. The features include:

Temperature (°C)
Wind Speed (m/s)
Solar Radiation (W/m²)
Energy Consumption (kWh)
Solar Generation (kW)
Wind Generation (kW)
Grid Fault (1 = Fault, 0 = No Fault)

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
To improve model performance, additional features were created:

Lag Features:Past values of energy consumption (Lag_1 and Lag_24).
Interaction Terms: Interaction between temperature and wind speed (Temp_Wind_Interaction) and total renewable energy generation (Solar_Wind_Generation).

\subsection{Dataset Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean Energy Consumption: 29.9 kWh
\item Grid Fault Occurrences: ~5.6% of data points represent grid faults.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Methodology}
\subsection{Load Forecasting}
A Decision Tree Regressor was implemented to predict energy consumption in the smart grid. Decision trees were chosen for their ability to model non-linear relationships and capture complex interactions between features without the need for extensive data pre-processing. The selected features included environmental variables such as temperature (°C), wind speed (m/s), and solar radiation (W/m²), alongside historical energy consumption data, as these factors significantly influence energy demand based on weather conditions and renewable energy availability.

Feature engineering was key to improving model performance. Two important lag features were introduced:
Lag1 -energy consumption in the previous hour and Lag24 -energy consumption 24 hours earlier, which captured both short-term and daily consumption patterns. Additionally, interaction terms such as Temp Wind Interaction were created to account for the combined effects of environmental factors on energy demand.
The dataset was split into 80 Percent training data and 20 Percent test data. To prevent over fitting and ensure generalization to unseen data, hyper parameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, and split criterion were tuned using cross-validation. The model was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, which measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, providing a clear assessment of the model's accuracy.
\subsection{Fault Detection}
For grid fault detection, a Random Forest Classifier was employed, utilizing an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce variance. The model was designed to classify whether a grid fault occurred (1 = fault, 0 = no fault) based on historical grid data and environmental factors. Input features included temperature, wind speed, solar generation, wind generation, and energy consumption, along with interaction terms such as Solar Wind Generation and Temp Wind Interaction. These interaction terms provided additional insights into the conditions under which faults occurred, enabling the model to identify patterns indicative of grid faults.

The dataset was split into 80 Percent training data and 20 Percent test data. Hyperparameters of the Random Forest model, including the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf, were optimized using a grid search method. The model's performance was evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to ensure accurate fault detection while minimizing false positives and negatives.

\section{Result}
The Decision Tree model proved to be effective for load forecasting, with the addition of lag features greatly enhancing its accuracy. However, it faced challenges during periods of rapid changes in energy consumption, indicating that exploring more complex models, such as gradient boosting, could be beneficial in future work.

On the other hand, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated strong performance in fault detection, particularly due to the incorporation of environmental factors. Its low rate of missed faults suggests that this model could be successfully implemented in a real-time monitoring system for the grid.
